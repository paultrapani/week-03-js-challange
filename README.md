# Week 3 - JavaScript Challenge

Write a Password Generator in JavaScript

## Description

The purpose of this repo project is to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. This app is meant to be run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean and polished responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Source Code Notes

A Project Starter Code package was used for HTML and CSS and partial JavaScript, which I downloaded from the Module 3 Challenge site on UCD Bootcamp Spot.  I have updated the HTML & CSS to make the design my own new unique version, and aside from the starter JavaScript code I wrote the rest myself by figuring it out step by step.  The script is still not fully functional yet.  I'm working so hard to get it done and working.
